# About ForgetMeNot
A project that helps people remmber their belongings' locations better. The drawer (our prototype) is able to sense door-opening/closing, weight-changing information and will update the server when the change is significant.
User will be prompted to enter the item name through an android app. When user wants to retrieve an item, the app will update the LEDstatus of the server and the drawer will get the LED status and light up the LED accordingly.
ESP8266 and Thingspeak are used for information transmission.
